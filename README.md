### Hi there 😄

My name is Samuel Santos from Brazil 📚. I've been learning Web Programming since 2019 and currently I'm looking for new opportunities 💬.

I'm currently learning about React, NodeJS and React Native. These technologies are amazing ❤️.

In my free time I like to play video games, to watch movies 🎞️ and series 📺, to read book 📚 (my eternal love), to listen to music 🎵, and eventually  I like to philosophize about life with a beer 🍺.
